Welcome to the ACHS WASC Chatbot!

Use this site to have an interactive conversation with our 2025 WASC Report.

You can access the draft of the main report here: ACHS 2025 WASC Report

The WASC Report is broken up into chapters:
Chapter 1: School Progress Report (Summarizing the past few years, developments, and progress)
Chapter 2: School Profile (Data about the school, student performance, and student outcomes)
Chapter 3: Self-Study (A thorough examination of our findings and evidence based on the WASC Focus on Learning Criteria)
Chapter 4: Summary of Self-Study Findings (A brief summary of major insights, areas of strength and growth from Chapter 3)
Chapter 5: Action Plan (What are our goals for the next three years and how do we hope to accomplish them?)
Based on your interest, you can ask for information about information from specific chapters or ask a general question. After your first question, you can have an increasingly detailed conversation with the bot on the same topic, or can move to different parts of the report.

Sample Starting Questions:
